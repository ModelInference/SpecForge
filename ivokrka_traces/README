=========================================
==== FULL TRACES (DTRACE, INV FILES) ====

There is a directory for each of the 9 data structures, each of which contains
trace (dtrace.gz) and invariant (inv.gz) files. Each directory also contains a
file args.txt that describes the arguments necessary for MTS Generator to parse
the traces.

MTS Generator takes the following parameters:
dtracepath invpath package class outpath

And args.txt defines the first 4 parameters (outpath can be any valid path). It
first contains line pairs where the first line is dtracepath and the second is
invpath, and each line pair would be a separate run of MTS Generator. The final
line of args.txt defines "package (space) class", which applies to all preceding
dtrace and inv pairs.

<-- BEGIN EXAMPLE args.txt -->
a.dtrace.gz
c.inv.gz

b.dtrace.gz
d.inv.gz

some.package SomeClass
<-- END EXAMPLE args.txt -->

The above example args.txt suggests two MTS Generator runs:

java MTSGenerator2.Generator_app a.dtrace.gz c.inv.gz some.package SomeClass
(and)
java MTSGenerator2.Generator_app b.dtrace.gz d.inv.gz some.package SomeClass


=========================
==== TRACE SUMMARIES ====

Each of the 9 data structure directories also contains a single plaintext file
traces.txt that lists all traces from the dtrace.gz files in that directory in a
flat format and excluding data information. The file defines multiple
invocations of the data structure class, and each line follows this format:
invocationidentifier /// programexitpoint
